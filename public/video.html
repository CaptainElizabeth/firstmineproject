    <h1>The Video Era</h1>
    <hr>
    <video width="400" height="400" controls>
        <source src="./video/WhoIAm.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your Browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <hr>
    <p>Oh no! You've found me! That sucks. Now you know who I am!</p>
    <p>Oh well. Now you know how videos look!</p>
    <p>Do you know how to install videos into your project? Well its just like how you do it with <a href="images.html">Images</a></p>
    <p>The only difference is that you put your video (as an mp4) into your /video directory</p>
    <p>Now, lets see how this video looks behind the scenes:</p>
    <hr>
    <p><code> &ltvideo width="400" height="400" controls&gt; <br>
        &lt;source src="./video/WhoIAm.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt; <br>
        Your Browser does not support the video tag. <br>
    &lt;/video&gt;</code></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Lets break it down!</p>
    <p>The <code>&ltvideo&gt</code> tag is used to add videos into your website</p>
    <p>Similar to the <code>&ltimg&gt</code> tag, the video needs a <i>height</i> and <i>width</i>.</p>
    <p>The &ltsource tag specifies where the video is located, and what type of video it is. In this example, the video is called ./video/WhoIAm and the type is a mp4 file.</p>
    <p>The message below this is just in case the video doesn't render. This happens if for some reason the browser doesn't understand the <code>&ltvideo&gt</code> tag. However, most browsers do.</p>
    <p>And thats it!</p>
    <h4>Remember:</h4>
    <p>You video <i>must be inside your /videos directory</i>. If it isn't then there is a chance the video won't work.</p>
    <p>Your video <i>must be saved as a certain file</i>. There are multiple ways to save a movie (ie mp4, ogg, etc.), and all you need to do is define the <b>type</b> of movie (see the example).</p>
