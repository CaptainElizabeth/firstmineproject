    <h1>Anchors</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome, Mateys! If you are wondering what Anchors are (The computer kind, not the physical one), you sir have just used one to get here!</p>
    <p>Anchors, also known as <b>Hyperlinks</b>, allow the user to click on them and be transported to another web page or document. Cool, Right! </p>
    <p>Now, there are many different types of hyperlinks, and they all are based on what "thing" the client clicks on to be redirected.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples. This first one is for simple word hyperlinks:</p>
    <code> &ltp&gt&lta href="anchor.html">Click Here&lt/a&gt to Learn more about Anchors!&lt/p&gt </code>

    <p>Now, another example is for image hyperlinks, which allow the client to click on an image: </p>
    <code> &lta href="index.html"&gt;
            &ltimg src="fakeimage.gif" alt="Example Link"
            style="width:50px;height:50px;border:0"&gt&lt/a&gt</code>
    <p>The example sets the image (fakeimage.jpg) to redirect to a certain document or website (index.html), and set the height and width of the image. (as well as the borders).  </p>
    <p><b>Basically,</b></p><code>&lta&gthref=_"</code> <b>defines what the new website and/or document the client will be sent to</b></p>
    <p>The text inside the &lta&gt <b>will be what text is hyperlinked.</b></p>
