<h1>Paragraphs: How to write them </h1>
<hr>
<p> <small>(Disclaimer: Should not be used in any English class)</small></p>

<p>So, you came to learn about Paragraphs, eh? Well, oh wise one, you're looking at it! </p>

<p>That's right! This text is a paragraph! Crazy, right?</p>
<p>The easiest way to write one is like so:</p>
<p><code>&ltp&gtHello World!&lt/p&gt</code></p>
<p>That comes out to, as expected: Hello World!</p>

<p>If you want to include &lt and &gt signs, then you have to enter in <b>HTML Exit Keys</b></p>
<p>These Keys notify the HTML interpreter that the signs are NOT going to be tags</p>
<p>If &ltp&gt was put into a paragraph, the interpreter would mistakingly create another paragraph!</p>
<p>To combat this, entering "&lt" to replace &lt, and "&gt" to replace &gt will show the signs on the browser.</p>

<p>There is also another tag that breaks apart paragraphs, so it is not a long one (like this)</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<p><code>&ltp&gtHel&ltbr&gtlo World&ltbr&gt!&lt/p&gt</code></p>

<p>That comes out to:</p>

<p>Hel<br>lo World<br>!</p>

<p>Keep in mind, if you're trying to make them double spaced, the browser automatically makes it single spaced. This is also true for spaces.</p>
