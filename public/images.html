<h1>The Arr!(t) of the Image</h1>

<img src="./images/edward-snowden-sxsw-lg.jpg" alt="My Self Portrait" style="width:650px;height:400px">
<p>I look good, don't I? That's right, you can put pictures into websites using HTML!</p>
<p>In order to begin, you need to put the image (of your choice) into your /images directory</p>
<p>Lets see some example code:</p>
<code>&ltimg src="./images/edward-snowden-sxsw-lg.jpg" alt="My Self Portrait" style="width:650px;height:400px"&gt</code>
<p>Here the tag &ltimg&gt is used</p>
<p>The picture name includes the ./images in front of it. This is the path that the image is located, in this case the images directory.</p>
<p>The <code>alt-"My Self Portrait"</code> is the message displayed if for any reason the image doesn't load. An example alt is "Error: Picture not loaded" </p>
<p>The style of the image is the appearance of said image on the website. <i>It defines the height and width of the picture (in px), and occasionally what type of borders it will have.</i></p>
<p>The result is a very <b>BEAUTIFUL</b> image of yours truly! (I know you agree too).</p>
